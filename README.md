* Plug USB cords into USB 3 ports or similar for the wattage & brightness.
* Those USB ports must be on their corresponding computers for grounding.
* Operate this apparatus with good audio hardware to eliminate noise.
* Don't forget to orient the LED based on the metallic shapes inside.

# MATERIALS:
```text
(2) USB cords           (any cord; only the power is used--back & red.)
(2) 3.5mm mono cords    (two connections/tip, pointy ends are connected to red, get one cord & cut it in half.)
(2) 2,200-ohm resistors (1/4 watt, 4 bands: red, red, red, gold,  $2 5-pack at Hobby Town USA part#: RSH2711325.)
(1) photoresistor       (use the smallest one of five in $5 assorted 5-pack at Hobby Town USA part#: RSH2761657.)
(1) blue LED            (5mm 3.2V 20mA, 467.5nm, 11,000mcd, 15 deg view, $6 at Hobby Town USA part#: RSH2760316.)
(1) S9018 transistor    (NPN transistor, find some CRT TVs and de-solder.)
(1) project box         (with a closing lid as shown--for good light insulation.)
