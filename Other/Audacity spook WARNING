Audacity has gone spooky; updated versions will log and broadcast your system
information, personal identifying information, what you're doing, where you're
doing it, and extensive crash reports... To law enforcement here and in Europe!


Unless a further notice, Audacity developers were given ice cream money and
asked to stop contributing to the project. Must be blazing where they live.
Now one ruler decides on commits. And now you must be 13+ years old to use it.
Still, you know what RICIN systems are for, and you know how to manage.
I cannot recommend the fork unless it's available via apt install on Devuan.
